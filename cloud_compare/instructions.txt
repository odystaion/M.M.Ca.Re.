Step 1: Choose Comparison Method: FRDS vs FSDR
Step 2: Choose Local Model: LS vs TRI vs HF
Step 3: By running the master script 3 scripts are executed
	-1. cc_multi_f.py: this script performs the CloudCompare actions of:
		a. Inputing the necessary objs
		b. Aligning them with ICP
		c. Subsampling their point-clouds
		d. calculating their distance based on the local model of STEP2
	-2. sorter_f.py: this script organises the outputs of the first script into folders
		a. LOGfiles: a history of actions performed in CloudCompare
		b. point clouds f: the color graded point clouds of the source
		c. other meshes: other objs or plys created during the process
	-3. plotter_auto.py: creates a point plot of the distances based on the comparison method of STEP1
		it also fits a polynomial equation to the points generated
